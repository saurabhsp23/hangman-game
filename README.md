#  Hangman Project

This project implements a LSTM-based Hangman game. The code has been modularized for better readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Directory Structure

- **`encode_utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for encoding the masked word and guesses.
- **`model_definition.py`**: Defines the neural network architecture for the Hangman game.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Includes logic for processing and preparing the training data.
- **`model_training.py`**: Provides the training logic for the neural network model.
- **`game_logic.py`**: Implements the core Hangman game logic, including the local Hangman game class.
- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the entire workflow, from data preparation to model training and playing the game.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Update the `data_preprocessing.py` with the path to your dataset if needed.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Run the `main.py` file to preprocess the data, train the model, and save checkpoints.

4. **Play the Game**:
   After training, the game logic can be tested by invoking the methods in `game_logic.py` or directly running `main.py`.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes an LSTM-based neural network model with an attention mechanism to predict letters in the Hangman game. The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Processing**: Converts words into masked inputs and target letters for prediction.
2. **Model Definition**: Builds an LSTM model with an attention mechanism.
3. **Training**: Trains the model using multiple examples of masked words.
4. **Game Logic**: Implements the logic for playing Hangman, including predictions and updates.
